## Encode x Polygon

Hello! We are Buddle Finance. The project is effectively a token bridge across multiple chains and networks. For this hackathon, we created a frontend, wrote and deployed subgraphs, and integrated Polygon. So, now users may bridge their assets to and from Polygon using our frontend deployed [here]().
